## Cloud ##
LightSchool can be used without any server nor programming knowledge. Just head to [lightschool.francescosorge.com](https://lightschool.francescosorge.com/) and signup for a free account.

## Self-hosted ##
By self-hosting LightSchool, you can tweak platform parameters to match your needs (like increasing disk space available). Please note that by doing that, you will be placed on a sort of "private track" and your LightSchool will not comunicate with the Cloud one in any way (e.g. users are not shared).
We recommend you to choose this option if you want to setup a "private" LightSchool for your education facility.

### Getting started ###
1. Download the whole project by either downloading it as a ZIP file or by using ```git clone https://github.com/sorge13248/lightschool.git``` in your terminal.
2. Place "public_html" folder content in the root of your webserver (or in a subfolder)
3. Place "secure" folder somewhere on your server not accessible from URL (one level below "localhost" would be perfect)
4. Create an empty database with charset utf8mb4 and assign a user for logging into the database
5. Navigate to the webserver URL in which you placed public_html folders and files
6. The automated install process will take care of the rest
7. Enjoy!
8. (Optional or something is broken) Check if files under config/ folder are set up with the correct values

## Third party library ##

* jquery/jquery
* jquery/jquery-ui
* twbs/bootstrap
